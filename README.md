Simple Calculator Project Overview
Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a basic calculator that can perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project demonstrates the use of Python programming for developing a user-friendly and functional calculator.

Features:
User Interface:

The calculator provides a simple text-based user interface.
Users can input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.
Arithmetic Operations:

Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero.
Error Handling:

Handles invalid inputs and prompts the user to enter valid numbers.
Includes error messages for division by zero and other invalid operations.
Implementation:
The project is implemented using basic Python programming constructs, such as functions, conditional statements, and loops. Below is a brief outline of the code structure:

Function Definitions:

Functions for each arithmetic operation: add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide().
A function to display the menu and get the user's choice of operation.
A main function to drive the program and handle user input and output.
User Input and Output:

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
It displays a menu of operations and asks the user to choose one.
Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function to perform the operation and displays the result.
Main Loop:

The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.</pre>
